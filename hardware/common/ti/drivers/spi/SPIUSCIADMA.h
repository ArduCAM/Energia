 *
 *  @brief      SPI driver implementation for a USCIA peripheral using
 *              the micro DMA controller.
 *
 *  The SPI header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/SPI.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/spi/SPIUSCIADMA.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  This SPI driver implementation is designed to operate on a UCSI controller
 *  in SPI mode. It uses the APIs for a USCIA controller.
 *
 *  ## SPI Chip Select #
 *
 *  The SPIUSCIADMA operates the controller in 3-pin mode; therefore it is not
 *  safe to use in a multi-master SPI bus environment. It is the application's
 *  responsibility to assert and de-assert a GPIO pin for chip select purposes.
 *
 *  <table>
 *  <tr>
 *  <th>Chip select type</th>
 *  <th>SPI_MASTER mode</th>
 *  <th>SPI_SLAVE mode</th>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Hardware chip select</td>
 *  <td>Not available on this peripheral.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *  <td>Software chip select</td>
 *  <td>The application is responsible to ensure that correct SPI slave is
 *      selected before performing a SPI_transfer().</td>
 *  <td>Up to the application's implementation.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  </table>
 *
 *  ## DMA Interrupts #
 *  The MSP430 DMA controller uses a single interrupt vector to handle all DMA
 *  related IRQ. Because of the "shared" nature, of the DMA's ISR, this driver
 *  implementation provides a simple ISR function SPIUSCIADMA_hwiIntFxn() which
 *  needs to be called from within the DMA's ISR.
 *  SPIUSCIADMA_hwiIntFxn() will only service DMA channel interrupts that are
 *  associated with the SPI_Handle. Each SPIUSCIADMA instance will require a
 *  call from within the DMA's ISR.
 *
 *  @code
 *  SPI_Handle spi0uscidma;
 *  SPI_Handle spi1uscidma;
 *
 *  // As this DMA controller uses a single interrupt vector for all DMA
 *  // channels (regardless of the triggering source), its left up to the user
 *  // to call SPI_serviceISR() to service its associated DMA channels.
 *  Void myDMAISR(UArg arg)
 *  {
 *      // Services and clears its assigned DMA channel interrupts
 *      SPI_serviceISR(spi0uscidma);
 *
 *      // Services and clears its assigned DMA channel interrupts
 *      SPI_serviceISR(spi1uscidma);
 *
 *      // some other user application code that's not related to the SPI driver,
 *      // but is used to service remaining DMA channels
 *  }
 *
 *  spi0uscidma = SPI_open(someSPI_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  ...
 *
 *  spi1uscidma = SPI_open(someSPI_configIndexValue, &params);
 *  ....
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  ## SPI data frames #
 *
 *  The USCI controller only supports 8-bit data frames.
 *
 *  dataSize  | buffer element size |
 *  --------  | ------------------- |
 *  8 bits    | uint8_t             |
 *
 *  ## DMA transfer size limit #
 *
 *  The MSP430 DMA controller supports 2^16 data frames per transfer. Each
 *  SPI driver instance requires 2 DMA channels (Tx and Rx) to operate.
 *
 *  ## DMA accessible memory #
 *
 *  Ensure that the txBuf and rxBuf (in ::SPI_Transaction) point to memory that
 *  is accessible by the DMA.
