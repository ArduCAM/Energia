<p class='vspace'></p><h2>constants</h2>
<p>Constants are predefined variables in the Energia language. They are used to make the programs easier to read. We classify constants in groups.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h3>Defining Logical Levels, true and false (Boolean Constants)</h3>
<p>There are two constants used to represent truth and falsity in the Energia language: <strong>true</strong>, and <strong>false</strong>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>false</h4>
<p>false is the easier of the two to define. false is defined as 0 (zero). 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>true</h4>
<p>true is often said to be defined as 1, which is correct, but true has a wider definition. Any integer which is <em>non-zero</em> is TRUE, in a Boolean sense. So -1, 2 and -200 are all defined as true, too, in a Boolean sense. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>Note that the <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> constants are typed in  lowercase unlike HIGH, LOW, INPUT, &amp; OUTPUT. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h3>Defining Pin Levels, HIGH and LOW</h3>
<p>When reading or writing to a digital pin there are only two possible values a pin can take/be-set-to: <strong>HIGH</strong> and <strong>LOW</strong>.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p><strong>HIGH</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>The meaning of HIGH (in reference to a pin) is somewhat different depending on whether a pin is set to an INPUT or OUTPUT. 
When a pin is configured as an INPUT with pinMode, and read with digitalRead, the microcontroller will report HIGH if a voltage of 3 volts or more is present at the pin. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>A pin may also be configured as an INPUT with pinMode, and subsequently made HIGH with digitalWrite, this will set the internal 20K pullup resistors, which will <em>steer</em> the input pin to a HIGH reading unless it is pulled LOW by external circuitry.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode, and set to HIGH with digitalWrite, the pin is at 3 volts. In this state it can <em>source</em> current, e.g. light an LED that is connected through a series resistor to ground, or to another pin configured as an output, and set to LOW.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p><strong>LOW</strong>
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>The meaning of LOW also has a different meaning depending on whether a pin is set to INPUT or OUTPUT. When a pin is configured as an INPUT with pinMode, and read with digitalRead, the microcontroller will report LOW if a voltage of 2 volts or less is present at the pin. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><p>When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode, and set to LOW with digitalWrite, the pin is at 0 volts. In this state it can <em>sink</em> current, e.g. light an LED that is connected through a series resistor to, +3 volts, or to another pin configured as an output, and set to HIGH.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h3>Defining Digital Pins, INPUT and OUTPUT</h3>
<p>Digital pins can be used either as <strong>INPUT</strong> or <strong>OUTPUT</strong>. Changing a pin from INPUT TO OUTPUT with pinMode() drastically changes the electrical behavior of the pin.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>Pins Configured as Inputs</h4>
<p>LaunchPad pins configured as <strong>INPUT</strong> with pinMode() are said to be in a high-impedance state. One way of explaining this is that  pins configured as INPUT make extremely small demands on the circuit that they are sampling, say equivalent to a series resistor of 100 Megohms in front of the pin. This makes them useful for reading a sensor, but not powering an LED.
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>Pins Configured as Outputs</h4>
<p>Pins configured as <strong>OUTPUT</strong> with pinMode() are said to be in a low-impedance state. This means that they can provide a substantial amount of current to other circuits. LaunchPad pins can source (provide positive current) or sink (provide negative current) up to 40 mA (milliamps) of current to other devices/circuits. This makes them useful for powering LED's but useless for reading sensors. Pins configured as outputs can also be damaged or destroyed if short circuited to either ground or 3 volt power rails. The amount of current provided by a LaunchPad pin is also not enough to power most relays or motors, and some interface circuitry will be required. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>Pins Configured as Input Pullup</h4>
<p>LaunchPad pins can be configured as <strong>INPUT_PULLUP</strong>. Often it is useful to steer an input pin to a known state if no input is present. This can be done by adding a pullup resistor (to ~3V), or a pulldown resistor (resistor to ground) on the input, with 10K being a common value.
There are also convenient pullup resistors built into the LaunchPad that can be accessed from software. These built-in pullup resistors are accessed in the following manner.
</p><br />
<pre>
pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP);           // set pin to input and enable internal pullup resistor
</pre>
<p class='vspace'></p><h4>Pins Configured as Input Pulldown</h4>
<p>Pins can be configured to support pulldown resistors.
<br />NOTE: Launchpad on-board button does not support <strong>INPUT_PULLDOWN</strong> for PinMode().  
</p>
</p>
<pre><br />
pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLDOWN);           // set pin to input and enable internal pulldown resistor
</pre><br />
